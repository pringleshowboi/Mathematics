Algorithms:

All computers follow a set of instructions creating algorithms
What we focus on should be breaking down distinct components that satisfy our algorithm

Tools and concepts to be made aware of:
(We also need to think abstractly)
Example

A Game: Which one is correct?
Person A: (Thinking of a number between 1-10)

Person X: Does the range begin 1-10? (Establishing the contraints and boundaries) Guesses
***Algorithmic thinking; defining problemset and define contraints and suitable insights***

Person Y: Guesses
----

What solution works best for the problem?
Algorithmic thinking involves trying to take the least amount of 'steps' to solve our problem, trying to solve our problem
involves understanding our range, systematical thinking aswell as creative thinking on how massive our problem is.
Algorithm; A set of instructions to reach our end goal with comparing our logic towards producing our solution.
(Tries / Checksums == Solution)?

There are many types of algorithms but these are what most algorithms are basically looking for:
